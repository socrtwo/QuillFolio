## Document of record and rendering

A tab holds a `PdfDocument` (the engine's object graph) and `bytes`, the PDF the viewer renders. After every edit the tab regenerates `bytes` with an incremental update (or a full rewrite when the document is encrypted or the preference says so) and pdf.js reloads it. pdf.js never writes; it only rasterizes and extracts text. Saving writes the same bytes to disk and reloads the document from them, so the next save is again a small incremental update.

## Undo

`DocTab.edit(label, fn)` snapshots the engine overlay (the map of changed objects, the trailer and the next object number), runs `fn`, and pushes the snapshot. Undo and redo swap snapshots, clear caches and re-render. Commands call `app.edit(...)`, which also refuses when the tab is read-only.

## Commands and gestures

Tools are commands that call `viewer.setTool(tool, opts)`. The viewer reports a finished gesture as `comment.toolDone` with the page, rectangle, points and options; the dispatcher in `commands/comment.ts` turns it into an engine operation. Annotations are selected by hit-testing the engine's annotation rectangles; dragging them runs `comment.moveAnnotation`. Thumbnail drags run `organize.moveTo`.

## Assets copied at build time

`scripts/copy-pdfjs.mjs` (run before dev, test and build) copies pdf.js CMaps, standard fonts, WASM decoders and ICC profiles to `public/pdfjs/`, and the tesseract.js worker and LSTM cores to `public/tesseract/`. Both folders are ignored by git.

## Tests

`npm test` runs the engine tests (filters, hashes, round trips, encryption), the operation tests (structure, annotations, forms, pages, extraction, text editing, optimization, repair of eight kinds of damage) and the registry tests (every ribbon id exists, the catalog is current, the Quick Access Bar order). `npm run e2e` builds a PDF in the browser through the engine, opens it, annotates, fills a field, rotates, saves both ways, reopens, searches, switches views and repairs a damaged copy.
